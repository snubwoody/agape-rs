//! The surfaces are the items that are actually responsible for drawing the pixels to the
//! screen. It is the final stage in the pipeline, each [`Surface`] surface holds the data
//! responsible for it's rendering needs, all surfaces, however, hold their [`Position`] and
//! [`Size`] which is calculated during the layout stage. There are currently five surfaces
//! - [`RectSurface`]: drawing rectangular primitives to the screen
//! - [`TextSurface`]: drawing text to the screen
//! - [`CircleSurface`]: drawing circle primitives to the screen
//! - [`ImageSurface`]: drawing images to the screen
//! - [`IconSurface`]: drawing icons to the screen
